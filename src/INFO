->PROCESS IS APPLICATION UNDER EXECUTION
->PROCESS CAN BE DIVIDED INTO NUMBER OF THREADS
->THREAD IS A LIGHT WEIGHT PROCESS
->THREAD LIFE CYCLE
    ->NEW  --> CREATION OF THREAD => Thread t1=new Thread()
    ->RUNNABLE  ->> in ready state ==> t1.start()
    ->RUNNING  ->>>  HERE THREAD IS PICKED BY AN THREAD SHEDULER WHICH IS UNDER CONTROL OF JVM  ->> IT HAS A CRITICAL SECTION WHERE THREADS ARE DOING THERE WORK
    ->BLOCKED  ->>>> IF THREAD WAS WAITING FOR ANY I/O RESOURCES THEN IT IS IN BLOCKED STATE --> AGAIN IT GO TO RUNNABLE STATE NOT RUN STATE
    ->TERMINATED  ->> IF THE THREAD SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED RUNNING STATE THEN IT ENTERS INTO THE TERMINATED

->MAXIMUM WE ARE DONT WRITE MAIN LOGIC IN MAIN THREAD IT IS ONLT FOR CONTROLLING
->

->THERE ARE TWO METHODS FOR USING THREADS IN JAVA
   1)USING EXTENDS THREAD
   2)USING IMPLEMENTS RUNNABLE


->JOIN ADN SLEEP

->JOIN -> IT STOPS THE OTHER THREAD UTIL IT COMPLETES IT WORK
->SLEEP -> IT WILL SLEEP FRO SOME TIME
